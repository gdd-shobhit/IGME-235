        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div class=details>
            <p><em>Resident Evil 2</em> takes the original 1998 game and it goes into uncharted territory
                for the story, gameplay and its supporting characters as well. This remake is
                more a re-imagining of the original than anything else, because the gameplay is
                totally different but the atmosphere is still there; and this one's got a more
                grounded approach. This one feels like a horror movie being acted out in real time,
                and its immersion is just right for 2019 gamers.

            <blockquote>
                For veterans who remember the original (and I reviewed it at the time), it
                is an unmissable nostalgic treat. For those who donâ€™t know their T-Viruses
                from their Code Veronicas, the experience is easily vivid and entertaining
                enough to stand on its own merits. This is horror game design as true craft. <br>
