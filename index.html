                Hi, my name is Shobhit Dhamania. I am International undergraduate Game Design and Development major student
                who is currently in 2nd year. I have always hated web design as i am literally a hardcore coder but i am 
                starting to like it. I want to at least learn how to create and publish a basic page from this class 
                as it is like a necessity for this era. I love to play sports. I have played Badminton professionaly and 
                right now i am trying out for the rowing team at RIT. I have a dream to open a game design company in India where there 
                is no good company for that. I want to be the first of my kind and make an impact towards my country. I am really 
                looking forward to learn whatever i can in the time being of my degree here.
